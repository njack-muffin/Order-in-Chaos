## 🧠 About the Challenge

In this machine learning competition, your task is to *sort shuffled video frames* back into their correct chronological order.  
It's a unique challenge that blends *computer vision, **temporal modeling, and **sequence learning*.

Think you can teach a machine to understand time or sequence?
