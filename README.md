## üß† About the Challenge

In this machine learning competition, your task is to **sort shuffled video frames** back into their correct chronological order.  
It's a unique challenge that blends **computer vision**, **temporal modeling**, and **sequence learning**.

Think you can teach a machine to understand time or sequence?

You are allowed to participate as an **individual** or as a **team**.

## üîç Problem Statement

Given a set of shuffled frames extracted from a video:

- **Input**: N unordered image frames from a single video.
- **Output**: The correct chronological sequence of those frames (as indices or filenames).

## üóÇ Dataset

- üì¶ **Dataset Format**: 
  - `Feature Templates/`: A folder with some provided features
  - `Randomized Images/`: A folder with images (e.g., 001.jpg, 002.jpg, ...)
  - `Readme.txt`: Some important information.

## üóÇ Submission

- Provide us your solution using this form - [**Link to Submission Form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeHFyql46rP1GfWDuaYgJWfcAYkYPExFIEpkjB-uoy4UEXrkw/viewform?usp=dialog)

## üß™ Evaluation Metric

Submissions are evaluated using:

 **Length of longest sub-sequence of ordered frames**<br><br>
 For example : <br>
If the correct sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- Suppose, if you have predicted [1, 3, 4, 5, 2], your Score : 4 as length of [1, 3, 4, 5] <br>
- Suppose, if you have predicted [3, 2, 4, 5, 1], your Score : 3 as length of [2, 4, 5] <br>

**Special points will be accordingly awarded if you do not use feature templates**<br>
